## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository includes implementations of **commonly used graph algorithms** — from basic traversals like BFS/DFS to more advanced algorithms like Dijkstra, Prim's, Kruskal’s, Union-Find, Tarjan's SCC, Topological Sort, and more.

Each algorithm is:
- Written in **Java**
- Structured for readability and modularity
- Often accompanied with **comments** explaining key logic
- Tested against various edge cases and input sizes

## ⚡ Motivation

Graph problems can feel overwhelming at first, especially with so many variations. But the more you practice, the more intuitive they become. This repo is a personal grind tracker and knowledge base.

> 💡 “Keep grinding — graph problems aren't magic, they're patterns. Once you see them, they’re hard to unsee.”
